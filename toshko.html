He is an alien
He’s not Romanian
He’s not afraid again, 
Toshko is gay

Says he does heroin
Not even Serbian

Goddamn, he got clout

Gets all the girls, don’t want get no nasty

To go do karate
Maybe he got a frown
But he does not care, he will be set free

Smart one in class, he has the fun (ahhh ahhh)

Funny in class, he had the fun (ahhh ahhh)

But he disconnected

He does martial arts
What had you suspected
Damn he state of the art, not like Descartes
He gay apprehensive

We bully him, tease him, and say stuff like, "you are gay"
He from Euro he play games, like croquet
He said he need a good girl to be pleased some day
We be chillin and he be like, "fuck you guys…"

He thinks he's cool, he's on Varisty
But he can't say no, yeah he can't say no
That we call him gay for doing what he loves 
But he is gay, is fuck-ing gay

Smart one in class, he has the fun (ahhh ahhh)

He’s not Romanian
He’s not afraid again,
