<h2 style="text-align:center"><b>This image shows a simpulation that represented the populations of a predator, prey, and an invasive species in a single environment. A graph is shown, which summarizes the effect each species has on each other. The predators were birds, the prey were bugs, the invaders were mice, and the food source was grass, which controlled how fast each species replicated.</h2>

<h3 style="text-align:center">The first change we made was to alter the stride speed of each animal, so that they end up moving faster than another species. Since the bugs were causing the bird species to die quickly when the grass wasn't there, we increased the speed of the birds from .3 to .5. We changed the color values of the animal shapes, and since the invaders were reproducing much too quickly for the other species to handle, we delayed their age when they reproduce to a value of 45 instead of 25.</h5>
